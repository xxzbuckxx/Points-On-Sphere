# Points on Sphere Calculation

This is a visualization for an algorithm that distributes points evenly on a sphere. My first attempts were at implementing the algorithm myself using [this stackoverflow post](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/9600801/evenly-distributing-n-points-on-a-sphere/44164075#44164075). However, I did not quite get the visualization I wanted, so I used [Sebastion Lague's implementation instead](https://github.com/SebLague/Boids/blob/master/Assets/Scripts/BoidHelper.cs).

## How To Run

To run the simulation locally in developer mode execute `npm run dev`.

To create a static build change the base in `vite.config.js` to the desired path and then execute `npm run build`.
